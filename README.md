# MissileCommandish
Missile Commandish is my homage/version of Missile Command. It's intention is to be pure like Missile Command with no power ups or upgrades--I wanted to make the game I remembered. It once made me some money on the iOS app store, but I don't want to pay Apple the annual fee any longer. This is my gift to the world. The first game I played as a child in an arcade, and the first game I ever created as a game maker. Do with it what you will.

Developer's Note: This project is basically me translating a game from AGK BASIC to Unity, because, during the last week of the BIG assignment, I was told by my game programming professor that I couldn't use BASIC, and had to use C# or Java instead.... Well this is what came of my translation AGK -> Unity. It's not pretty, but it works.
